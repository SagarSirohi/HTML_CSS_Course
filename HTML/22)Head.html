    <title>HTML - The Head Element</title>

        <!-- The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style> <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>. -->

            The HTML <head> Element
            The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
            
            HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
            
            Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
            
            The HTML <title> Element
            The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
            
            The <title> element is required in HTML documents!
            
            The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
            
            The <title> element:
            
            defines a title in the browser toolbar
            provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
            displays a title for the page in search engine-results
            So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
