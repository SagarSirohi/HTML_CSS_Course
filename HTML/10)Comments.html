        HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
        HTML Comment Tag
            You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
            <!-- Write your comments here -->
            Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add Comments
            With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
            <!-- This is a comment -->
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <!-- Remember to add more information here -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Hide Inline Content
            Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
            <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
    </p>
