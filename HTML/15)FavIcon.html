        A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

            How To Add a Favicon in HTML
            You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.

            Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

            A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab, like this:

            Example of favicon
            To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

            Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:
                <head>
                    <title>My Page Title</title>
                    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
                </head>
            Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser. Your browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the page title.

            Use the HTML <link> element to insert a favicon
