        HTML Links - Hyperlinks
            HTML links are hyperlinks.

            You can click on a link and jump to another document.

            When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
    </p>

        HTML Links - Syntax
            The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

            <a href="url">link text</a>
            The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

            The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

            Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
            An unvisited link is underlined and blue
            A visited link is underlined and purple
            An active link is underlined and red
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML Links - The target Attribute
            By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

            The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

            The target attribute can have one of the following values:

            _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
            _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
            _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
            _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
            Example
            Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Visit google</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Link to an Email Address
            Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

            Example
            <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Link Titles
            The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

            Example
            <a href="https://www.google.com" title="Go to google HTML section">Visit here</a>
    </p>


    <p>
        An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.
            HTML Link Colors
            By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

            An unvisited link is underlined and blue
            A visited link is underlined and purple
            An active link is underlined and red

            You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
            <style>
            a:link {
              color: green;
              background-color: transparent;
              text-decoration: none;
            }
            a:visited {
              color: pink;
              background-color: transparent;
              text-decoration: none;
            }
            a:hover {
              color: red;
              background-color: transparent;
              text-decoration: underline;
            }
            a:active {
              color: yellow;
              background-color: transparent;
              text-decoration: underline;
            }
            </style>
            </head>
            <body>
            
            <h2>Link Colors</h2>
