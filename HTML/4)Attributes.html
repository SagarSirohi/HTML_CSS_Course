        HTML Attributes
            All HTML elements can have attributes
            Attributes provide additional information about elements
            Attributes are always specified in the start tag
            Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
    </p>
    <p>
        The href Attribute
            The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
            <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The src Attribute
            The <img> tag is used to add an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
            <img src="Path.jpg">
            There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

                1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.google.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

                2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="Path.jpg".
    </p>
    <p>
        The width and height Attributes
            The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels).
            <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
    </p>
    <p>
        The alt Attribute
           The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
           <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
    </p>
    <p>
        The style Attribute
            The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
            <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The lang Attribute
            You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The title Attribute
            The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
            The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element.
            <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
    </p>
