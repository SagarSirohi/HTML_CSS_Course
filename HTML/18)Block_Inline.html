    <title>HTML Block and Inline Elements</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

            There are two display values: block and inline.

            Block-level Elements
            A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

            A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

            Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

            The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

            The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

            The <p> element is a block-level element.

            The <div> element is a block-level element.
            Example
            <p>Hello World</p>
            <div>Hello World</div>
            Refer to 6.png
    </p>
    <p>
        Inline Elements
            An inline element does not start on a new line.

            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

            This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

            Example
            <span>Hello World</span>
            Refer to 7.png
    </p>
    <p>
        The <div> Element
            The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
            
            The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
            
            When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
            
            Example
            <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
              <h2>London</h2>
              <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
            </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span> Element
            The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
            
            The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
            
            When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
            
            Example
            <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
    </p>
