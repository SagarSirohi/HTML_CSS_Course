        Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

            What are Semantic Elements?
            A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

            Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

            Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

        Semantic Elements in HTML
            Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

            In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

            <article>
            <aside>
            <details>
            <figcaption>
            <figure>
            <footer>
            <header>
            <main>
            <mark>
            <nav>
            <section>
            <summary>
            <time>
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML <section> Element
            The <section> element defines a section in a document.
            
            According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
            
            Examples of where a <section> element can be used:
            
            Chapters
            Introduction
            News items
            Contact information
            A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
            
            Example
            Two sections in a document:
            
            <section>
            <h1>WWF</h1>
            <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
            <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
            <p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
            </section>
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML <article> Element
            The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
            
            An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
            
            Examples of where the <article> element can be used:
            
            Forum posts
            Blog posts
            User comments
            Product cards
            Newspaper articles

            The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
